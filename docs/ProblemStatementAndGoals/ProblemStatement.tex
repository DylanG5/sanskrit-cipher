\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
The textual history of Indian Buddhism is fragmented across thousands of manuscript folios, preserved only in partial, damaged, or scattered forms. Traditionally, scholars reconstruct these texts manually through palaeographic study, transcription, and content comparison; a slow and error-prone process. While some existing computational tools exist for pattern recognition and Optical Pattern Recognition (OCR) none can tackle this problem as they are not designed for irregular, damaged, or arbitrarily oriented manuscript fragments. 

The lack of computational tools available for this problem significantly limits progress in reconstructing Buddhist textual history. Scholars need a tool that automates the detection, matching, and transcription of manuscript fragments, thereby reducing manual effort and time; enabling large-scale reconstruction.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Inputs:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item High quality images of manuscript fragments (approximately 21{,}000 images from collections)
      \item Metadata (collection identifiers, orientation, partial transcriptions if available)
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Outputs:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Probabilistic matches between fragments based on shape/edge/damage features (i.e., list of fragments most likely related to an input fragment image)
      \item Enhanced Metadata:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Suggested transcriptions of fragment text
        \end{itemize}
      \item Searchable/sortable database containing fragment attributes and relationships
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Stakeholders:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Scholars of Buddhist textual history (religious studies, philology, palaeography)
        \item Supervisors and domain experts (e.g., Dr. Shayne Clarke, McMaster Religious Studies)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Secondary Stakeholders:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Computer science researchers in AI, image processing
        \item Humanities researchers studying textual transmission and manuscript culture

    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{End Users:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Academic researchers using the software to assemble fragments
        \item Graduate students seeking computational support in philological research
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hardware:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Development laptops/workstations with GPU support for ML tasks
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Software:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item VScode
        \item Coding Libraries
        \item Database
        \item GitHub repository for version control and CI/CD
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a tool that:
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item Detects edges, shapes, and damage patterns in fragments.
        \item Matches fragments based on similarity measures (probabilistic scoring).
        \item Identifies palaeographic script of fragments.
        \item Performs preliminary transcription using OCR tuned to Sanskrit scripts.
        \item Builds a searchable database linking fragments with metadata and probable matches.
        \item Provides a user interface for scholars to view suggested fragment matches and confirm/annotate them.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Expand support to Tibetan and Chinese manuscript fragments.
  \item Incorporate semantic content matching with other fragments.
  \item Improve transcription accuracy with AI-assisted error correction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User Documentation:} Write user-friendly guides for scholars with limited technical expertise.
  \item \textbf{Use Case Video:} Make a Video on how to use the tool so that we can minimize the learning curve for the intended user
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}  



\hspace{2em} What went well the most would be that everyone was on the same page for this project and so coming up with what we wanted to accomplish was pretty easy and we didn't really have many disagreements. This made it easy to focus on the task of writing the problem statement and goals rather than having to worry about different opinions on the team. This project was also one of the projects that was on the list of projects pdf given to us so it was easy to figure our the problem statement and goals since we didn't really have much to come up with anything on our own. 

\hspace{2em} One challenge was avoiding either too much technical detail or too much abstraction. We really had to focus on what we wanted to convey and add too much detail as to not contrain our selves but also not have too little detail that it isn't clear as to what we are doing. We initially struggled to find the right balance between scholarly needs (manuscript context) and technical specifications (ML algorithms, environment). We resolved this by starting broad, then refining with feedback and checking against the POC and problem statement checklists. That way we made sure that our POC and problem statement were in line with each other. Another pain point was uncertainty about which machine learning techniques would realistically be feasible; to address this, we distinguished between core goals and stretch goals to avoid overcommitting. This way we also didn't contrain oursleves later down the line when we start implementing the solution.

\hspace{2em} Initially, we considered a full end-to-end system covering Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese manuscripts. We recognized this was quite ambitious especially given the time and resources that we had. Instead, we narrowed our core scope to Sanskrit fragments only, focusing on orientation correction, edge/damage-based matching, and preliminary script identification. Transcription and cross-lingual extensions were moved into stretch goals as they are not the core goals that we are trying to achieve with this project. If we are ahead of schedule then they would be great additions to add to the project but again as mentioned they are not the core focus of this project. This adjustment ensures the project is challenging enough, but achievable within the Capstone timeline.
