\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

\subsection{Main Risks for Project Success}

The most significant risk for our Buddhist manuscript fragment reconstruction platform is the complexity of developing reliable computer vision algorithms that can accurately detect and match irregular fragment edges, damage patterns, and script similarities. Unlike standard OCR applications that work with uniform, complete text pages, our system must handle fragments with varying orientations, lighting conditions, and preservation states.

\subsection{Implementation Challenges}

The most challenging aspects of implementation will be:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Computer Vision Pipeline}: Developing robust edge detection and pattern matching algorithms that work reliably across diverse fragment conditions, lighting, and image quality.
\item \textbf{AI Model Training}: Creating and training machine learning models for fragment similarity matching when we may have limited training data initially.
\item \textbf{Interactive Canvas}: Building a responsive, intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can handle potentially hundreds of fragment images while maintaining performance.
\item \textbf{Multi-scale Matching}: Implementing algorithms that can suggest matches at different confidence levels for users with varying expertise (students vs. experts).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Difficulties}

Testing will present unique challenges because:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ground Truth}: We need access to known fragment matches from Buddhist Studies scholars to validate our algorithms, which may be limited initially.
\item \textbf{Subjective Validation}: Fragment matching often involves scholarly interpretation, making automated testing metrics challenging to define.
\item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Testing the system with large batches of high-resolution fragment images will require substantial computational resources.
\item \textbf{User Experience Testing}: The interface must be intuitive for scholars with varying technical backgrounds, requiring extensive usability testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Library and Technology Risks}

Several specialized libraries may present installation challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Computer Vision Libraries}: OpenCV, scikit-image, or similar packages may have complex dependencies, especially for GPU acceleration.
\item \textbf{Machine Learning Frameworks}: TensorFlow or PyTorch installations can be environment-specific and require proper GPU drivers.
\item \textbf{Image Processing}: Large-scale image processing may require specialized libraries with system-specific optimizations.
\item \textbf{Web Framework Dependencies}: Real-time collaborative features may require WebSocket libraries and associated infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware and Infrastructure Concerns}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Processing Power}: Computer vision and AI algorithms may require substantial CPU/GPU resources for real-time performance.
\item \textbf{Memory Requirements}: Loading and processing large batches of high-resolution images simultaneously.
\item \textbf{Network Bandwidth}: Uploading and sharing large image collections across research institutions.
\item \textbf{Storage Scalability}: Managing growing collections of fragment images and associated metadata.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demonstration Plan}

To address these risks and demonstrate feasibility, our POC will focus on:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Basic Image Upload and Display}: Demonstrate the ability to upload fragment images and display them in an interactive workspace.
\item \textbf{Simple Edge Detection}: Show basic computer vision algorithms working on sample fragment images to detect edges and key features.
\item \textbf{Prototype Matching}: Implement a simplified similarity matching algorithm that can suggest potential fragment connections.
\item \textbf{Interactive Interface}: Create a basic drag-and-drop canvas where users can manipulate fragment images to test potential matches.
\item \textbf{Performance Baseline}: Demonstrate the system can handle a small batch of fragment images without significant performance issues.
\end{itemize}

This focused demonstration will validate that the core technical challenges can be overcome while providing a foundation for the full system implementation.

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}
