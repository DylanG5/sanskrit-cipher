\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Version Control \& Workflow:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be making use of GitHub with a feature-branch workflow. Each task/issue will get its own branch.
        \item All code changes require a pull request and at least one approval from a reviewer before a merge to the master branch.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item All PRs must follow a standardized naming convention:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item [Issue \#] Name of feature
            \end{itemize}
            \item All PRs must also contain a standardized description outlining the details of the change:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item  What?
                \item  Why?
                \item  How?
                \item  Testing?
                \item  Screenshots (optional)
                \item  Anything Else
                \item Refer to \url{https://arc.net/l/quote/touaacbp}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Commit messages must contain a short description of the change being added to the feature branch.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Issues \& Project Tracking Boards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be making use of a Kanban board on GitHub to track our projectâ€™s progress.
        \item This Kanban board will contain Issues and will overall be split up into 4 separate categories:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To-Do
            \item In Progress
            \item Pending Review
            \item Done
        \end{itemize}
        \item Issues will be used with templates for things like bugs and tasks.
        \item We will also be making use of Labels:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bug, enhancement, documentation
            \item Easy
            \item Needs design (design discussion required)
            \item Due By \dots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Milestones:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be creating milestones in GitHub corresponding to all major deliverables:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item POC
            \item Rev0
            \item Rev1
            \item Final
        \end{itemize}
        \item Each issue will be linked to a milestone.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be making use of GitHub Actions to trigger a CI pipeline.
        \item Each push and pull request will trigger:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Build automation:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Utilizing makefiles to compile all modules
                \item \textbf{(ALREADY COMPLETED)} automatically build .tex files into PDFs
            \end{itemize}
            \item Some sort of linter for style compliance
            \item Unit test suite
            \item Deployment
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}


As mentioned previously, we will be making use of a Kanban board through GitHub Projects to manage all of our tasks. Each task will be associated with an Issue and linked to milestones corresponding to all major deliverables (POC, Rev0, Rev1, Final). We plan on dividing tasks based on knowledge built through personal experiences as well as interest; however, each task will be reviewed cross-functionally to ensure shared knowledge.

\noindent
Each major milestone will contain deliverables within them.

\subsection*{Major Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Proof of Concept (POC)
    \item Revision 0
    \item Revision 1
    \item Final
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Deliverables from Course Outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Team Formed, Project Selected
    \item Problem Statement, POC Plan, Development Plan
    \item Requirements Doc and Hazard Analysis Revision 0
    \item V\&V Plan Revision 0
    \item Design Document Revision -1
    \item Proof of Concept Demonstration
    \item Design Document Revision 0
    \item Revision 0 Demonstration
    \item V\&V Report and Extras Revision 0
    \item Final Demonstration (Revision 1)
    \item EXPO Demonstration
    \item Final Documentation (Revision 1)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Task Decomposition}
We plan on breaking down all tasks into features that can be completed in a few hours of work rather than days.

Some examples would be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design database schema draft
    \item Implement orientation correction function for fragments
    \item Write test plan for OCR module for Sanskrit Input
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We want to make sure that the tasks (Issues on GitHub) we create are specific and not open to much interpretation. We also want to ensure that they are easy to test and estimated in hours. During our weekly meetings, we will be identifying large chunks of work and decomposing them into digestible chunks. This will be completed through discussion and trying to gain an understanding of the task at hand.

\subsection*{Assigning Work}
Initially, task assignment will be based on interest and strengths. However, as we move on, we plan on rotating tasks to prevent overspecialization and to ensure everyone has a chance to explore areas of interest. Each task will have both an assignee and a reviewer.

\noindent
Additionally, each team member will be expected to commit approximately 10 hours per week of work dedicated to this project. This includes meetings with peers or professors, tutorial time, and actual development time.


\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?
