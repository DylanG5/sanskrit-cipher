\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

\subsection{Main Risks for Project Success}

The most significant risks for our Buddhist manuscript fragment reconstruction platform are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inconsistent OCR Performance}: OCR accuracy varies dramatically across different manuscript conditions, script styles, and image quality. Ancient Buddhist texts often contain deteriorated characters, non-standard orthography, and multiple script variations that challenge standard OCR engines.


\item \textbf{Lack of Positive Training Examples}: The absence of confirmed fragment matches creates a training data challenge. Without verified examples of fragments that belong together, we will need to explore unsupervised learning approaches and develop alternative validation strategies for our matching algorithms.
\end{itemize}

These are risks because they directly impact the core functionality of our system - the ability to accurately identify which fragments belong together.

\subsection{Implementation Challenges}

The most challenging aspects of implementation will be:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{OCR Integration and Consistency}: Implementing OCR engines that can handle Sanskrit manuscript variations while maintaining consistent output across different image conditions and script styles.
\item \textbf{AI Model Training Without Ground Truth}: Creating and training machine learning models for fragment similarity matching without access to verified positive examples of matched fragments. The final model will need to combine multiple features (OCR text, edge patterns, damage signatures) into confidence scores, which presents challenges for training validation. We plan to explore unsupervised learning approaches to address this challenge.
\item \textbf{Interactive Canvas}: Building a responsive, intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can handle potentially hundreds of fragment images while maintaining performance.
\item \textbf{Multi-scale Matching}: Implementing algorithms that can suggest matches at different confidence levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Difficulties}

Testing will present unique challenges because:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ground Truth}: We need access to known fragment matches from Buddhist Studies scholars to validate our algorithms, which may be limited initially.
\item \textbf{Subjective Validation}: Fragment matching often involves scholarly interpretation, making automated testing metrics challenging to define.
\item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Testing the system with large batches of high-resolution fragment images will require substantial computational resources.
\item \textbf{User Experience Testing}: The interface must be intuitive for scholars with varying technical backgrounds, requiring extensive usability testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Library and Technology Risks}

\subsection{Hardware and Infrastructure Concerns}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Processing Power}: Computer vision and AI algorithms may require substantial CPU/GPU resources for model training.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demonstration Plan}

To address these risks and demonstrate feasibility, our POC will focus on proving that the core technical challenges can be overcome:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{OCR Functionality Demonstration}: Show OCR engines successfully extracting text from sample manuscript fragments with varying quality levels. We will demonstrate text extraction from both clear and degraded fragments to validate OCR consistency approaches.
\item \textbf{Image Segmentation and Normalization}: Demonstrate fragment segmentation algorithms that can isolate individual fragments from composite images and normalize them for consistent analysis (rotation correction, standardization).
\item \textbf{Basic Feature Extraction}: Show extraction of key features from fragments including edges, text content, and damage patterns that could be used for matching.
\item \textbf{Prototype Similarity Metrics}: Implement basic similarity algorithms that compare normalized fragments and provide confidence scores, acknowledging the limitation that it will be difficult to validate accuracy without ground truth data.
\item \textbf{Interactive Workspace}: Create a basic interface where users can upload fragments, view OCR results, and see preliminary similarity suggestions.
\end{itemize}

This demonstration will prove the technical feasibility of the core components. The POC focuses on demonstrating that our technical approach can extract and compare the right types of features for fragment matching. While the absence of ground truth data presents challenges, we will explore unsupervised learning techniques and develop validation approaches that can work with the available data.

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}
