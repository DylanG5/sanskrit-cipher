\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } [fill in this information]

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the

{Google calendar} for the capstone course.}

\wss{NOTE: There will be approximately 13 lectures between the start of class
and the POC demos}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

The team charter had the following quantified triggers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Attendance Triggers:} All team members were expected to attend all meetings unless a valid excuse was provided in advance. 
  This included team meetings and supervisor meetings, and missing a meeting without a valid excuse would count as a violation. This 
  also includes leaving a meeting early or being late without a valid excuse.
  \item \textbf{Performance Triggers:} Team members were expected to complete their assigned tasks on time and participate in providing code reviews and feedback. 
  All team members were expected to equally contribute to the project, and the team was expected to work together to ensure that the team's performance met the project goals.
  \item \textbf{Communication Triggers:} Team members were expected to equally participate in group discussions, communicate effectively with each other, and respect each other's opinions.
  Team members were also expected to follow the code of conduct outlined in the team charter, which included treating each other with respect and professionalism. 
  \item \textbf{Decision-Making Triggers:} Team members were expected to actively participate in decision-making processes, which involved using a consensus-based approach for decision-making. 
  No team member was to take control of the decision-making process in any circumstance.
\end{itemize} 

There have been the following violations of the triggers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Decision-Making:} There have been a couple of instances where consensus-based decision-making was not fully adhered to, which was necessary in instances
  where team members did not need to be involved in certain decisions.
  \item \textbf{Performance:} The team has been falling behind schedule on some tasks, leading to delays in the overall project timeline. Although all team members have been contributing to the project, and we
  have completed all milestones on time, we have been finishing our milestones with less time to spare than originally planned.
\end{itemize}

To address these violations, the team plans to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Adjust Decision-Making Triggers:} In instances where certain team members do not need to be involved, the team will be able to decide without all team members involved. 
  However, consensus-based decision-making will still be used for major decisions that affect the entire team.
  \item \textbf{Prevent Violation of Performance Triggers:} We will reiterate the importance of adhering to the project timeline and ensure that all team members are aware of their responsibilities and deadlines.
\end{itemize}
