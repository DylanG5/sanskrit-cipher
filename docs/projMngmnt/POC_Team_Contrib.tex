\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

\wss{What will you be demonstrating}

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } [fill in this information]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the
\href{https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=rnboqiaki1k2la7rpu3bn0um58@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Toronto}
{Google calendar} for the capstone course.}

\wss{NOTE: There will be approximately 13 lectures between the start of class
and the POC demos}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the lecture attendance can be provided here.}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\noindent \textbf{TA's Name: } [fill in this information]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the attendance can be provided here.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & Num & 100\% \\
Name 1 & Num & \% \\
Name 2 & Num & \% \\
Name 3 & Num & \% \\
Name 4 & Num & \% \\
Name 5 & Num & \% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Omar El Aref & 16 & 6 \\
Dylan Garner & 6 & 4 \\
Aswin Kuganesan & 4 & 4 \\
Yousef Shahin & 3 & 4 \\
Muhammad Umar Khan & 14 & 5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The assigned \& completed issues are consistent across team members, there is some variation in created issues due to things like supervisor \& TA meetings and granularity of issues created for self-assigned tasks.

\section{CICD}

Our project utilizes GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Automated LaTeX Compilation}: A CI/CD workflow automatically compiles LaTeX documentation files whenever changes are pushed to the \texttt{docs/} directory. The workflow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Uses TeXLive 2024 with full scheme
\item Detects changed .tex files and compiles only those files
\item Automatically commits generated PDFs back to the repository
\item Runs on both push and pull request events to the main branch
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Front-end Build and Deployment}: CI/CD will automatically build and deploy the front-end application after changes are made to the source code, ensuring the latest version is always available.

\item \textbf{Database Repopulation}: Automated workflows will repopulate sample databases after changes are made to the underlying models and logic that generates metadata for each manuscript fragment image. This ensures database schemas and sample data remain consistent with code changes.

\item \textbf{Linting \& Automated Testing}: We will automate linting according to the appropriate style guides, as well as execute our automated test suites where applicable on a PR.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

\wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
add them to this report.}
