\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the POC
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the beginning of the term
and the POC demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

For the POC demo we will provide a lightweight implementation that demonstrates our purpose without requiring an end-to-end pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Run a scripted orientation correction routine on a handful of sample fragments to verify we can standardize inputs for later stages.
  \item Present precomputed OCR outputs to discuss accuracy limits and mitigation strategies.
  \item Demonstrate a notebook that extracts simple visual features (edges and damage silhouettes) and compares two fragments side-by-side.
  \item Share preliminary similarity scoring results generated offline and explain how they will feed into future matching heuristics.
  \item Walk through low-fidelity interface mockups that illustrate the planned researcher workflow for reviewing fragment evidence.
\end{itemize}
Together these elements show that we have validated critical preprocessing steps, established baselines for OCR and feature comparison, and framed the user workflow we will build out in upcoming milestones.

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the
\href{https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=rnboqiaki1k2la7rpu3bn0um58@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Toronto}
{Google calendar} for the capstone course.}

\wss{NOTE: There will be approximately 13 lectures between the start of class
and the POC demos}

\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the lecture attendance can be provided here.}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\noindent \textbf{TA's Name: } [fill in this information]

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the attendance can be provided here.}

\section{Commits}

\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for
the entire team since the beginning of the term.  The percentage is the
percentage of the total commits made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & Num & 100\% \\

Name 2 & Num & \% \\
Name 3 & Num & \% \\
Name 4 & Num & \% \\
Name 5 & Num & \% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\

Name 3 & Num & Num \\
Name 4 & Num & Num \\
Name 5 & Num & Num \\

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

\wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
add them to this report.}
