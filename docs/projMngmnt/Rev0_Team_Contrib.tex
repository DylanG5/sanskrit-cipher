\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

In this demo, we will showcase the current functionality implemented across both the user interface and machine learning components of the system. This includes recent UI updates such as improved search and filter functionality, dynamic scaling and interaction on the canvas, and fragment annotation support. We will also demonstrate the end-to-end ML pipeline, highlighting fragment segmentation, line count detection, circle classification, script type identification, and scaling behavior. Together, these demos illustrate how the UI and ML components integrate to support efficient fragment exploration and analysis.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: } [fill in this information]

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Omar ElAref & 1\\
Muhammad Umar Khan & 0\\
Dylan Garner & 0\\
Aswin Kuganesan  & 0\\
Yousef Shahin & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\noindent \textbf{TA's Name: } Tanya Djavaherpour

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 3\\
Omar El Aref & 3\\
Dylan Garner & 3\\
Muhammad Umar Khan & 3\\
Aswin Kuganesan & 2\\
Yousef Shahin & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Some members of the team missed the last TA document discussions due to having a midterm that was scheduled right after that discussion. However, the team members that attended the discussion talked about the team's concerns with the TA and shared the discussion notes with the rest of the team after.

\section{Commits}


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 335 & 100\% \\
Omar El Aref & 11 & 30.6\% \\
Dylan Garner & 19 & 52.7\% \\
Muhammad Umar Khan & 3 & 8.3\% \\
Aswin Kuganesan & 1 & 2.8\% \\
Yousef Shahin & 2 & 5.6\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The difference in the number of commits between team members can be attributed to the varying size of each commit, as some members may make larger, more comprehensive commits while others commit more frequently with smaller changes. Additionally, some team members have ongoing work that has not yet been merged into the main repository, which is not reflected in these commit counts.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Name 1 & Num & Num \\
Name 2 & Num & Num \\
Name 3 & Num & Num \\
Name 4 & Num & Num \\
Name 5 & Num & Num \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

\wss{Provide a summary of the quantified triggers identified in the team's
charter.}

\wss{Provide a list of any violations of the triggers.  If the team wishes, the
violations can be summarized on aggregate, instead of naming specific team
members.}

\wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}

\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}

\wss{If your team has additional metrics of productivity, please feel free to
