\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Definition of Hazard}

Following the definition from hazard analysis literature, a \textbf{hazard} is defined as a property or condition in the Sanskrit Manuscript Fragment Reconstruction Platform system together with a condition in the environment that has the potential to cause harm or damage (loss).

\subsubsection{System Conditions}

System conditions are properties or states of the software that create vulnerability or risk. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerable database configuration}: Database exposed to unauthorized access attempts
\item \textbf{Inaccurate Artificial Intelligence (AI) models}: Script classification model with low accuracy (<50\%)
\item \textbf{Insufficient input validation}: System accepts malformed or malicious data
\item \textbf{Poor error handling}: System crashes or enters unstable state on unexpected input
\item \textbf{Inadequate session management}: Sessions persist beyond intended duration or lack proper isolation
\item \textbf{Resource allocation issues}: Memory leaks, unbounded queries, or inefficient algorithms
\item \textbf{Missing accessibility features}: Interface elements without keyboard navigation or screen reader support
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environmental Conditions}

Environmental conditions are external circumstances or user behaviors that, when combined with system conditions, can cause harm. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{User attempts unauthorized data access}: User tries to download entire database or access restricted content
\item \textbf{User trusts inaccurate AI predictions}: Scholar bases research conclusions on low-confidence model outputs
\item \textbf{Network interruptions during critical operations}: Connection lost while saving research data
\item \textbf{Concurrent user access to shared resources}: Multiple researchers editing same fragment simultaneously
\item \textbf{Users with varying technical expertise}: Non-technical users attempting complex system operations
\item \textbf{Users with accessibility needs}: Users requiring assistive technologies to interact with system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Context and Unique Hazard Considerations}

The Sanskrit Manuscript Fragment Reconstruction Platform operates within a distinctive environment that creates unique user experience hazards not typically addressed in conventional software projects:

\subsubsection{Diverse User Base with Varying Technical Skills}
The system serves users ranging from graduate students learning paleography to expert scholars to archival staff, each with different technical comfort levels and research needs. Poor interface design or insensitive feature implementation could exclude or frustrate significant user groups, leading to abandonment of the tool or ineffective research workflows.

\subsubsection{Research Workflow Integration Challenges}
Scholars have established research methodologies and workspace preferences developed over years of practice. Software that disrupts familiar workflows, lacks intuitive navigation, or forces users to adapt to rigid system constraints can cause significant frustration and reduce research productivity. Poor performance or unreliable functionality breaks concentration and research flow.

\subsubsection{Data Privacy and Confidentiality Concerns}
Researchers work with sensitive data including unpublished discoveries, institutional collaborations, and potentially restricted manuscript materials. Unintended data exposure through system vulnerabilities, poor session management, or inadequate access controls could compromise ongoing research, violate institutional agreements, or expose confidential scholarly work to competitors.


\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\subsection{Purpose}

This hazard analysis identifies and evaluates potential risks associated with the Sanskrit Manuscript Fragment Reconstruction Platform to ensure safe, responsible deployment in academic research environments. The analysis focuses on protecting cultural heritage materials, maintaining scholarly integrity, and preventing negative impacts on Buddhist Studies research. Through systematic verification testing and validation processes, this analysis helps identify potential system failures and ensures that main functionalities operate safely and reliably before deployment.

\subsection{Potential Losses}

Table~\ref{TblPotentialLosses} summarizes the potential losses that could occur from identified hazards in the system. These losses span data security, user experience, research productivity, and system reliability concerns.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{itemize}
\item Exclusion of users with disabilities
\item Frustration for non-technical users
\item Reduced adoption by diverse user groups
\item User abandonment from steep learning curve
\end{itemize}\\

\end{table}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

This hazard analysis treats the system as four major component groups that interact to support scholarly reconstruction of manuscript fragments. (For full details, refer to the SRS, Section~S.1.)

\subsection*{Major Component Groups}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Front-end}: Scholar-facing web UI for secure login, batch image uploads, an interactive canvas (arrange/rotate/zoom fragments), match discovery display, and session/annotation saving. Quick list of smaller components:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item User Authentication Interface
    \item Fragment Upload Interface
    \item Interactive Canvas Module
    \item Match Discovery Module
    \item Progress Management Module
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Backend}: API gateway, authentication/authorization, image preprocessing pipeline (normalization/orientation/format), database access layer, and a match-orchestration service coordinating analysis results. Concise breakdown of sub-components:
   \begin{itemize} 
    \item API Gateway
    \item Authentication Service
    \item Image Processing Service
    \item Database Access Layer
    \item Match Orchestration Service
   \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Storage}: Fragment image store (originals and derivatives with metadata), user accounts/permissions, and project records (arrangements, match history, confidence scores, session snapshots). Brief overview of minor elements:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Fragment Image Database
    \item User Database
    \item Project Database
   \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{AI/ML}: Services/models for edge/damage matching, handwriting/script classification, OCR text extraction (with confidence), and content similarity/embedding comparisons. Summary of key smaller parts:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Edge Pattern Matching Model
    \item Handwriting Style Classifier
    \item Damage Pattern Recognition Model
    \item Text Extraction Model
    \item Content Similarity Model
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Component Boundaries (Exclusions)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{UI} presents results and collects inputs; it does not run ML models or make authoritative scholarly decisions.
  \item \textbf{Preprocessing} only standardizes images; it does not judge correctness of reconstructions.
  \item \textbf{Matching} produces scored suggestions; it does not auto-merge/link records without explicit user confirmation.
  \item \textbf{OCR/Transcription} is machine-generated with confidence indicators; final text requires human review before being marked confirmed.
  \item \textbf{Datastores} are system-of-record for this application only; they do not write back to external catalogues/corpora.
\end{itemize}

See SRS Section~S.1 for the detailed component descriptions and interfaces. Note that here I have separated the backend and data storage to make it a little clearer to visualize the components but data storage will be treated as backend for the project.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
