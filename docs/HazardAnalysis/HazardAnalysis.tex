\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

This hazard analysis treats the system as four major component groups that interact to support scholarly reconstruction of manuscript fragments. (For full details, refer to the SRS, Section~S.1.)

\subsection*{Major Component Groups}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Front-end}: Scholar-facing web UI for secure login, batch image uploads, an interactive canvas (arrange/rotate/zoom fragments), match discovery display, and session/annotation saving. Quick list of smaller components:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item User Authentication Interface
    \item Fragment Upload Interface
    \item Interactive Canvas Module
    \item Match Discovery Module
    \item Progress Management Module
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Backend}: API gateway, authentication/authorization, image preprocessing pipeline (normalization/orientation/format), database access layer, and a match-orchestration service coordinating analysis results. Concise breakdown of sub-components:
   \begin{itemize} 
    \item API Gateway
    \item Authentication Service
    \item Image Processing Service
    \item Database Access Layer
    \item Match Orchestration Service
   \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data Storage}: Fragment image store (originals and derivatives with metadata), user accounts/permissions, and project records (arrangements, match history, confidence scores, session snapshots). Brief overview of minor elements:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Fragment Image Database
    \item User Database
    \item Project Database
   \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{AI/ML}: Services/models for edge/damage matching, handwriting/script classification, OCR text extraction (with confidence), and content similarity/embedding comparisons. Summary of key smaller parts:
  \begin{itemize} 
    \item Edge Pattern Matching Model
    \item Handwriting Style Classifier
    \item Damage Pattern Recognition Model
    \item Text Extraction Model
    \item Content Similarity Model
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Component Boundaries (Exclusions)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{UI} presents results and collects inputs; it does not run ML models or make authoritative scholarly decisions.
  \item \textbf{Preprocessing} only standardizes images; it does not judge correctness of reconstructions.
  \item \textbf{Matching} produces scored suggestions; it does not auto-merge/link records without explicit user confirmation.
  \item \textbf{OCR/Transcription} is machine-generated with confidence indicators; final text requires human review before being marked confirmed.
  \item \textbf{Datastores} are system-of-record for this application only; they do not write back to external catalogues/corpora.
\end{itemize}

See SRS Section~S.1 for the detailed component descriptions and interfaces. Note that here I have separated the backend and data storage to make it a little clearer to visualize the components but data storage will be treated as backend for the project.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
